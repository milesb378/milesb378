# Hello
![title](location of pic)
My name is a highly classified document. Coincidentally, all Americans use my name, while non-Americans laugh at the stupiditiy of it. I am American, in ninth grade and some of my favorite things are:
+ Reading
+ Sleeping
+ Eating 
+ Running
+ Hiking

Reading and eating *at the same time* is one of the best things that a human can do. 
I am the fourth son out of five. I have lived in three different countries outside of the US.
